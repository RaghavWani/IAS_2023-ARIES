# IAS_2023-ARIES
Indian Academy of Sciences Summer Research Fellowship Program at Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) Nainital in year 2023. In this project, I developed a python pipeline to preform the task of image cleaning and aperture photometry of astronomical images. Using this pipeline, I detected a few variable stars in the open star cluster NGC 6709. 

Details regarding data acquisition and processing are mentioned in the final report, along with results of variable star detections. Implementation of mentioned procedure in well presented in the final python code.
